# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm i` 
to install all the dependencies.
Then run the below command to start the app.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Steps to interact:
1 First user comes on product page.
2 Onclick of Product details in sidebar user goes to product page and on Compare products it goes to compare page.
3 On click of compare user move to compare page and oclick of add more modal will open and user can select product to compare.
4 User can't select more than 4 products.
5 User can remove product on click of remove button present below for particular product.
6 User can go back to product page on click of "back to product page" button but 2 product needs to be present otherwise user can go by sidebar button.
7 On click of toggle mode button sidebar and navbar color changes.
8 Table is created using Ant design
9 Pagination is also implemented and navbar is fixed.
10 Notification is also implemented which show on compare button click and remove button.
11 2-way binding is also done.



### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
